Interesting stuff: https://12factor.net/

Although not everything applies in mobile dev, my takeaway is:

* Version it all, duh!
* Pin dependencies, including your dev env
* External APIs are external, not in your control
* Prefer loose coupling and less state
* Maintain minimum difference dev/prod
